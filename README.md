# Campsite Checker

(my first real project, per [@poddarh](https://github.com/poddarh)'s suggestion) 

Uses [this Python script](https://github.com/banool/recreation-gov-campsite-checker) to monitor recreation.gov for campsite availability.
Notifies via email.

Express + MongoDB. Was deployed on Heroku for a while, RIP.
